# React JS Library

This is one of my ReactJS repositories, containing projects I have made with it. React is a Javascript library that Facebook created to help build custom HTML elements. It is a powerful tool for front-end development, and is rapidly becoming the most widely used library to date, which is why I chose to learn about it. Their website: https://reactjs.org/

## Instructions:
* React code (JSX) is found in 'app' folders
* Pure JS has been translated and put in the 'build' folders
* You need to have Node.js installed to have access to the NPM
* You need to set up a local development environment, more details: https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html#how-to-follow-along

## Projects:

### [Intro](/intro/)

This project is to learn the basics of JSX (the language React uses, a variation of JS). I have created a simple clock which shows the current time and updates every second.

### [Social Media Card](/social-media-card/)

This is a simple React project where I have made a social media card with data. I initialized a JSON variable which holds the necessary data needed, and with JSX, I have written classes to display that data orderly to look like a profile card. After that was done, I finished it off with adding some CSS to make it look more appealing. There are many things you can do with this base structure, such as getting the JSON data as input, combining databases with JSON, etc.
