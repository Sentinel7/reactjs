# React JS Library

This is one of my ReactJS repositories. React is a Javascript library that Facebook created to help build custom HTML elements. It is a powerful tool for front-end development, and is rapidly becoming the most widely used library to date, which is why I chose to learn about it. Their website: https://reactjs.org/

## Instructions:
* React code (JSX) is found in 'app' folders
* Pure JS has been translated and put in the 'build' folders
* You need to have Node.js installed to have access to the NPM
* You need to set up a local development environment, more details: https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html#how-to-follow-along

## Projects:

### [Intro](/intro/)

This project is to demonstrate features of JSX (the language React uses is a variation of JS). I have created a clock which shows the current time and updates every second.

### [Social Media Card](/social-media-card/)

Here, I have made a component which is a social media card that contains personal data. I initialized a JSON variable which holds the necessary data needed, and I have displayed the ordered data with JSX. After that was done, I finished it off with adding some CSS to make it look more appealing.

### [Pomodoro Timer](/pomodoro/)

This project is a Pomodoro Timer app. The Pomodoro timer is a well-known productivity interval that has been shown to improve your productivity. It gives you an interval of 25 minutes of work followed by a 5-minute break. After 4 work intervals, there is a 15-minute break. I have used React CDN's for making this app, they can be found in the index.html file.
